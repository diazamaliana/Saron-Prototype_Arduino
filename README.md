# Saron Prototype - Arduino
 This is a final project for the Interfacial and Peripheral Engineering course in 2018. This prototype uses the FL Studio midi sequencer software to help produce the sound of the gamelan 'Saron'. Arduino functions as a MIDI interface that will enter MIDI commands into FL Studio according to the desired tone. To enter MIDI input, a push button is used which represents each note in the gamelan.
